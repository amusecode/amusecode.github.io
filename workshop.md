We are organising an AMUSE workshop from ~~June 1-4~~ July 12-16, 2021.
This workshop will be held fully online.

We are announcing the workshop “MODEST-21a” about the AMUSE simulation environment. This workshop is aimed at both current users of AMUSE and those who would like to get to know it.

The aim of the workshop is to discuss AMUSE: recent improvements made to it, how it is used by you, and how it could be improved. Sessions will be organised in an “unconference” like manner without a fixed programme, focusing on discussion. The current topics we will address include:
- New advances with AMUSE: updates since the 2018 textbook
- Observations and simulations: using one to inform the other
- Hybrid simulations: examples of simulations that combine physical processes
- Hierarchical systems: examples of simulations that couple different size scales

This workshop will be held fully online on Zoom and Slack, from July 12-15, and will be free to attend. We will organise two 2-hour sessions each day, from 10:00-12:00 UTC and from 14:00-16:00 UTC, to accommodate participants in different timezones. Talks will be recorded and made available to participants via Slack. The registration deadline is **June 25th**.

We would like to invite you all to participate in this workshop and help direct the future development of AMUSE. Please let us know if you will attend, if you would like to give a short talk and if so, which session you think is most appropriate. For talks, we are particularly interested in hearing about:
- How does AMUSE help you conduct your research
- What questions do you consider interesting/doable
- What techniques do you use
- How do you do validation and verification of your simulations
- How do you compare your simulations with observations
- How do you generate initial conditions

The deadline for submitting an abstract is **Friday June 11th**.
