The workshop "MODEST-21a: AMUSE" will be from July 12-15, 2021.
The aim of the workshop is to discuss AMUSE: recent improvements made to it, how it is used by you, and how it could be improved.
Sessions will be held in an “unconference” like manner without a fixed programme, focusing on discussion but guided by talks.
The workshop will be held fully online on Zoom and Slack.

We will have two 2-hour sessions each day, from 10:00-12:00 UTC and from 14:00-16:00 UTC, to accommodate participants in different timezones.
Talks will be recorded and made available to participants via Slack.

The schedule for the workshop is as follows:

**Monday**: *"The state of AMUSE"* (Chairs: Martijn Wilhelm and Simon Portegies Zwart)\
We will introduce AMUSE and new advances made in the last two years, including new features and simulation codes. 
Further discussion will be on how AMUSE can fit in with other (simulation) tools.\
*Speakers (morning)*: Inti Pelupessy, Simon Portegies Zwart, Steven Rieder\
*Speakers (afternoon)*: Rob Farmer, Peter Teuben, Martijn Wilhelm

**Tuesday**: *"Bridging physical domains"* (Chairs: Inti Pelupessy and Alison Sills)\
We will discuss how to successfully run simulations that include codes from multiple physical domains.\
*Speakers (morning)*: Sambaran Banerjee, Christian Boily, Hila Glanz, Steven Rieder\
*Speakers (afternoon)*: Claude Cournoyer-Cloutier, Jeremy Karam, Aaron Tran

**Wednesday**: *"Bridging spatial domains"* (Chairs: Steven Rieder and Jeremy Webb)\
We will discuss simulations that involve multiple scales.\
*Speakers (morning)*: Alessandro Trani, Long Wang\
*Speakers (afternoon)*: Francesco Flammini Dotti, Nathan Leigh

**Thursday**: *"Observations and tools"* (Chairs: Christian Boily and Tjarda Boekholt)\
We will discuss how to successfully include observations and observational tools with AMUSE.\
*Speakers (morning)*: Anne Buckner, Mathias Michielsen, Steven Rieder\
*Speakers (afternoon)*: Alison Sills, Jeremy Webb

We are announcing the workshop “MODEST-21a” about the AMUSE simulation environment. This workshop is aimed at both current users of AMUSE and those who would like to get to know it.

The aim of the workshop is to discuss AMUSE: recent improvements made to it, how it is used by you, and how it could be improved. Sessions will be organised in an “unconference” like manner without a fixed programme, focusing on discussion. The current topics we will address include:
- New advances with AMUSE: updates since the 2018 textbook
- Observations and simulations: using one to inform the other
- Hybrid simulations: examples of simulations that combine physical processes
- Hierarchical systems: examples of simulations that couple different size scales

This workshop will be held fully online on Zoom and Slack, from July 12-15, and will be free to attend. We will organise two 2-hour sessions each day, from 10:00-12:00 UTC and from 14:00-16:00 UTC, to accommodate participants in different timezones. Talks will be recorded and made available to participants via Slack. The registration deadline is **June 25th**.

We would like to invite you all to participate in this workshop and help direct the future development of AMUSE. Please let us know if you will attend, if you would like to give a short talk and if so, which session you think is most appropriate. For talks, we are particularly interested in hearing about:
- How does AMUSE help you conduct your research
- What questions do you consider interesting/doable
- What techniques do you use
- How do you do validation and verification of your simulations
- How do you compare your simulations with observations
- How do you generate initial conditions

The deadline for submitting an abstract is ~~Friday June 11th~~.
