We organise biweekly user meetings, alternating between Thursday afternoon and Friday mornings (European time).
The user meetings are open to all AMUSE users, from beginners to experts.
They are an excellent opportunity to ask us anything you wanted to know about AMUSE, from installation issues to advanced bridging methods.

These meetings and other AMUSE related events are announced on Github: [https://github.com/amusecode/amuse/discussions/categories/events](https://github.com/amusecode/amuse/discussions/categories/events)
